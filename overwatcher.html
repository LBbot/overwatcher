                <h3>Marcin Rausch’s Hero Story</h3>
                <div class = "datetime">10/29/2018</div>
                <p>Marcin ”Ganisz” Rausch is the founder of the Academic League, now known as T-Mobile Academic League (or TMLA), the largest collegiate esports league in Poland. After a successful first season, T-Mobile partnered with the organization as a sponsor to support its mission: to build bridges between the esports and academic communities. Rausch hopes that the league can bring students together to developer meaningful relationships as they play or support their schools’ teams. In his mind, there’s no reason that universities in Poland shouldn’t be able to benefit from the promotional opportunities that collegiate esports programs bring to schools in other countries.</p>
                <p>We spoke to Rausch about his experience starting TMLA, where he sees the league going in the future, and his love of Overwatch.</p>
